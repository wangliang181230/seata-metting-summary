# Matters to be discussed

1. `resource-id` + `application-name` unique identifier confirmation @ChenJianbin has a lower priority and currently does not have time (we will initiate further discussions when we have time)
    - `resource-id` may be duplicated, leading to issues with distribution. Ensure uniqueness, and the final solution is tentative. Please reschedule the meeting for discussion
        - Damang Database: Only one schema can be filled in (confirmed with Damang technical personnel)
    - Next meeting communication, prepare documents; Require dynamic scalability;

2. Seata go direction:
    - Ecological expansion: Bilibili and other service frameworks @Jimin Byte @HaoHongfan. See if we can do it again next week or not by the end of January. (I talked to Byte's Cloud-We-GO and found that the article is hanging on both sides. They will help review it.)

3. Console token automatically refreshes @LiuQiufeng scheme completed done (pending voting, deadline Monday, 20231225) Junmin PR next week
     - [Discussion on Token Automatic Renewal Scheme Selection]（ https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/discussions/6180 ）
     - PR to be submitted (priority authentication processing for TM and RM)

4. `TYPE_SEATA_MERGE` messages require an independent thread pool to handle @ChenJianbin Todo
    - [Message independent thread pool for TYPE_SEATA_MERGE · Issue #6197 · apache/incubator-seata (github.com)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/issues/6197)
    - The plan has been determined: divided into two thread pools, one NIO thread pool, and one message processing thread pool.
    - PR has not made any progress yet

5. The issue of the startup sequence of RM/proxy init @Haitao will start investing at the end of January
    - TM/RM not initialized, rm registered, no longer ignored, direct exception; TODO, confirm `io.seata.core.rpc.netty.RmNettyRemotingClient#registerResource
      getClientChannelManager().getChannels().isEmpty()`
    - The plan has been determined, PR is under development, progress: 70% @Haitao

6. Jackson is strongly dependent on scope provided and has been modified to compile dependency @Yixia @Haitao
    - Low priority: @Haitao

7. 2.1 version core synchronization: (marked with * as important, must be uploaded)
    - Multi version protocol PR split, not included in plan 2.1;
    - Console configuration (linked to various configuration centers for push pull), @WangLiang 2.1 version not available, separate meeting for discussion; (When the task is sent out, if the PR can be reused, reuse it; if not, restart the PR)
    - Saga enhancement; Console Saga designer redesign; Drive front-end resources and keep up with tasks;
    - Function enhancement: done
    - Insert console: done (implemented by triggering nodejs script through Maven plugin)
    - Parallel tasks (PR not merged)
    - Saga Trace Spring: PR has been submitted, but due to package name adjustment, it needs to be adjusted again. We will review it later.
    - Priority authentication, Junmin. Version 2.1 is required, please let me know if there are any issues
    - Token renewal: If version 2.1 cannot catch up, it will not be available
    - ~SQL parser: remove~
    - Error code, merge in the first version first;
    - Old io. seata APIs are compatible;
    - RocketMQ integration

8. Multiple threaded branch registration rollback sequence error or omission
    - [Issue # 6311: The issue of concurrent use of seata by multiple threads]（ https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/issues/6311 ）
    - Resulting in issues with data dependent branches and incorrect rollback order@ChenJianbin (Plan to be discussed: performance and consistency issues, need to be discussed in a meeting again)
    - Multiple threads create multiple branches, and when the transaction resolution is rolled back, there are still branches registered, resulting in one less branch being read during the rollback, causing the rollback order to be out of order, and rolling back the transaction.
    - The solution can be to merge and roll back, for example, the same resource can be rolled back at once in a single distribution, which can avoid the problem of multiple distributions and possible incorrect rollback order. When distributed locally, it is completely possible to select for update to query the corresponding undo log of xid and roll back according to the local timestamp.
    - The disadvantage of undo is that its datatime accuracy needs to be accurate to the nanosecond level

9. Discussion on compatibility issues between high and low versions of Server:
    - Raft mode:
        - Port synchronization issue (solution: metadata synchronization to solve this problem)
    - Protocol solution:
        - sofa-bolt: @Yixia synchronize the issue
        - grpc: 
        - python: 

10. Confusion issue with articles related to Seata on the market: @Jimin
